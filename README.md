# audio_player

# Description 
An audio playback machine providing the bone-structure to a streaming platform for music listening abilities. This program is currently only compatible with wav formatted audio files. 

# Setup
The first step is providing a wav file in the data folder with the following specifications: 16 bit, 44,000khz. Once the file is correctly placed, open a terminal window and navigate to the audio_player folder. Then cd into the wss folder and type cargo run. This initializes the server. Remaining in the audio_player file structure, open a seperate terminal window and run the command wscat -c 127.0.0.1:9001. This opens the connection to an endpoint for the "client". Once connceted, type the name of the wav file, in this case sample_wav, and the wav file will be streamed.

# Audio File Background Information
